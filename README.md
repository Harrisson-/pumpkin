# tags

Small VueJs component "contenteditable div" who can correctly handle hashtag.
Without Jquery.

:warning: this project is stile in WIP :warning:
I get some problems with the caret position handling after updating the innerHtml of the div.
And there is no unit test for the moment to maintaint code quality.

# launch project 
Go to /tags directory

npm install

npm run serve
